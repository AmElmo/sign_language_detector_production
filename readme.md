This repo contains the production setup for this project: https://github.com/AmElmo/sign_language_detector

It is a simple app that:
- displays a live video stream with holistic keypoints detected in real-time (using the Mediapipe library in JavaScript)
- load an LSTM model previously trained using Tensorflow JS
- automatically detects sequences of sign languages
- translates the sequences with the relevant symptom
